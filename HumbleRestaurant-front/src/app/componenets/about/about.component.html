      <h2>Our Goal</h2>
      <p>
          The mission of MunchCare is to help subsidize healthcare costs for those in need.
          Specifically, we will be funding for patients who have any kind of cancer, heart disease, or genetic disorder.
          We plan on raising funds for our mission through other businesses in exchange for advertisement.
